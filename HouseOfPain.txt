It's little past supper time
I'm still out on the porch step
sitting on my behind
waiting for you

Wanting everything is alright
Mama says come in boy don't waist your time
I said I've got time
well, he'll be here soon

Five years old and talkin to my self
Where were you?
Where'd you go?
Daddy can't you tell?

I'm not trying to fake it
and I ain't the one to blame
No there's no one home in my house of pain
and I didn't write these pages
and my scripts been rearranged
No there's no one home in my house of pain
No there's no one home in my house of pain

Wasn't I worth the time?
A boy needs a daddy
like a dance to mime
and all the time I looked up to you
I faced my room a million times
And all I every got was one big lie
The same old lie
