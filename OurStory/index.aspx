                It was in the first part of 2007, in Provo Utah, when Ana and Walter first met.
                Both were attending the Oak Hills 8th Ward – a singles Ward of the LDS Church, and
                Walter was assigned to home teach Ana. Through home teaching visits and singles
                activities they quickly became friends. Over the next two and half years they fostered
                their friendship even as they each dated other people.
                <br />
                <br />
                At the end of September 2009 their feelings for each other started to change and
                by October they decided to date. Oct 5, 2009 they shared their first kiss. On March
                31, 2011 Walter wrote in his journal that he wanted to marry Ana. However it wasn’t
                until December 2012 that they seriously talked about getting married, nevertheless
                the timing wasn’t right and for a while they went their separate ways while missing
                each other. Then in July 2013 they rekindled their friendship, and were soon dating
                again. At the end of November 2013 Walter took a trip to Mexico and they missed
                each other greatly. Upon his return they both realized marriage was the next step
                for their relationship.
                <br />
                <br />
                On December 6, 2013 Walter got down on his knee and asked Ana to marry him. Three days after their engagement, 
		they obtained a marriage license in
                Utah County, and booked an appointment at the Orem court house to be married December
                12, 2013 at noon. Since they were eloping, they didn’t tell anyone their plans,
                with the exception of two witnesses who were required to attend the ceremony, namely
                Ana’s sister Alma, and their mutual friend Alan Moore.
                <br />
                <br />
                Both Ana and Walter enjoy cooking, and eating healthy. In the winter they enjoy
                going snowshoeing, and skiing, and in the summer they like hiking and riding bikes.
                Ana is very involved with a local Crossfit gym. Walter likes to climb mountains,
                and do both rock and ice climbing. Ana occasionally goes climbing with Walter. They
                both like to travel. Ana enjoys doing crafts, and spending time with her nieces
                and nephews. Walter enjoys home improvement projects and gardening.

                Ana was born in Mexico City, and at the age of four her family relocated to Caborca,
                Sonora, Mexico (about 100 miles south of Arizona) where she was raised. Ana is the
                firstborn in her family and has two brothers and one sister, namely Alejandro, Alma,
                and Roberto. Ana enjoyed school, and was an honor roll student. In her free time
                Ana liked reading, doing crafts, and spending time with her cousins.
                <br />
                <br />
                In high school Ana earned an accounting certification, following which she landed
                a job with a local accounting firm. That job lead to a better job with a multi-faceted
                business, where Ana managed several companies. She held that job for ten years,
                until she decided to relocate to Utah.
                <br />
                <br />
                Initially Ana intended to live in Utah for just one year, but during the year she
                grew fond of Utah, enjoying the site of the mountains, as well as the four seasons.
                Also the climate helped relieve her of her allergies. As a result she decided to
                stay in Utah, and began learning English.
                <br />
                <br />
                From the time she moved to Utah she had several visits from the LDS missionaries.
                In 2006 one of the missionaries who had taught her at the first of his mission knocked
                on her door again near the end of his mission. She had moved since the last time
                they had met, but they recognized each other right away. Over the next month, through
                both missionary and member visits Ana was touched by the Spirit and decided to join
                the LDS Church. Her family, back in Mexico, had joined the Church several years
                earlier and was very happy Ana was now a member too.
                <br />
                <br />
                Ana has worked in customer service and office administration for several companies
                in Utah County. She currently works for Dialogue Marketing where she uses both her
                English and Spanish language skills.

                Walter was born in Ogden Utah, but just before his third birthday his family moved
                to Cardston, Alberta, Canada where he was raised. Walter grew up with two older
                siblings; his sister Lisa and his brother Peter. His senior year of high school
                his rank as the youngest in his family ended when his younger brother Kenneth was
                born. Growing up Walter was a good student, including being the top math student
                in his high school. He was known for his sense of humor and was often the class
                clown. Outside of school Walter played sports including softball, ice hockey, and
                skiing. Walter has always had a love of the outdoors and was active in the boy scouts,
                and spent a lot time camping, hiking, cycling, and fishing with both friends and
                family.
                <br />
                <br />
                After high school Walter moved to Provo Utah to attend Brigham Young University.
                After his first year at university he was called on an LDS mission to Adelaide Australia.
                Following his mission he returned to BYU where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree.
                Upon graduation Walter moved back to Alberta, and was hired by the Toronto Dominion
                bank into their management training program. After a couple of years Walter lost
                interest in banking and ended up in South Korea where he worked as an English teacher
                for one year. Following his year in South Korea Walter accepted a job as an Economist
                at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington DC. During his time at the BLS Walter
                taught himself how to write computer programs, and how to develop websites, and
                that lead to him entering the field of Information Technology. For the last sixteen
                years Walter has worked as a Software Engineer.
                <br />
                <br />
                Walter spent eight years living in Northern Virginia and working in the DC area.
                In 2005 he relocated to Utah where he currently resides.
